The task is based on answering the following questions:
1. Generating a thousand points using a multivariate distribution and calculating their arithmetic mean.
2. Sample selection using the Gibbs Sampling method and calculating the mean, number of steps, number of samples, and accuracy.
3. For high-dimensional data, can estimating the mean accurately be achieved by updating a limited number of features and obtaining samples?
